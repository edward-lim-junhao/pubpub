			<h2>About The Unjournal</h2>
			<p>
				<em>We are not a journal!</em>{" "}
				<a target="_blank" href="https://unjournal.org">
					<em>The Unjournal</em>
				</a>{" "}
				does not 'publish any papers in a journal'; we organize and fund public,
				journal-independent feedback, rating, and evaluation of hosted papers and
				dynamically presented research projects.
			</p>
			<p>
				Peer review is great, but conventional academic publication processes are wasteful,
				slow, and rent-extracting. They discourage innovation and prompt researchers to
				focus more on 'gaming the system' than on the quality of their research. We provide
				an immediate alternative and at the same time offer a bridge to a more efficient,
				informative, useful, and transparent research evaluation system.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our evaluations and ratings are hosted here on PubPub, along with manager summaries,
				author responses, and links to the research being evaluated. Each evaluation and
				response is given a DOI and indexed by bibliometrics and academic search engines
				(such as Google Scholar).
			</p>
			<p>
				Our initial focus is quantitative work that informs global priorities, especially in
				economics, policy, and social science. We encourage better research by making it
				easier for researchers to get feedback and credible ratings on their work.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>The Unjournal</em> does not charge any fees. In fact, we{" "}
